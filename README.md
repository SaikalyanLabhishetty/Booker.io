Booker.io: Saikalyan Labhishetty
1) I have created this app using web development and react.js.
2) The features I've used in this project are react-elastic-carousel and typewriter for the main page.
used forms for both the sign-up page and the booking page.
4) Import createBrowserRouter and Routerprovider for activating routes between the webpages.
5) Used React Hooks such as Usestate and Use Effect.
6) I tried to deploy this on.render, but I encountered an error with the module, so it is not found in React 17. so I'll try to upload that. In the meantime, I'll attach screenshots of the application as well.
